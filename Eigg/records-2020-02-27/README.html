Data sharing statement that participants were made aware of before submitting data: If you supply the Woodland Trust with scientific or environmental records e.g. as part of a citizen science or volunteer project, they will be carefully stored by us and/or our project partners. Such records may include, for example, species information, location, dates and species photographs. Scientific data sharing helps to further research, education and our national understanding of biodiversity and conservation issues. Hence anonymised scientific data may be shared with project partners and third parties such as the National Biodiversity Network, academic researchers and students. In some circumstances such scientific data may be sold, but the income will be directly used to support the running cost of these data-gathering projects.
